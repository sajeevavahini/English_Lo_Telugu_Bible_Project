# English Lo Telugu Bible Project

Sajeeva Vahini's groundbreaking initiative introduces the "English Lo Telugu Bible" project, a pioneering open-source endeavor aimed at making the Telugu Bible accessible to a wider audience by presenting it in the English script. This innovative project caters to individuals who may be more comfortable reading in English while preserving the essence of the Telugu Bible's teachings. Through this initiative, Sajeeva Vahini is fostering inclusivity and reaching a diverse global community, providing a valuable resource for those seeking spiritual enlightenment in a familiar linguistic context.
